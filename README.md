Azure IoT Edge Classification Module
----

This uses a PyTorch Squeezenet model for image classification encapsulated in an Azure IoT Edge module for running on Edge Devices or in the Simulator.

## Prerequisites

1.  Docker (Community Edition) for Mac or Windows
2.  Visual Studio Code (VSCode) text editor with IoT Edge extension (to get this go to View -> Extensions and type in "IoT Edge", select "Azure IoT Edge") - alternatively all of the work may be done on the command line as is shown in [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux).
3.  Azure IoT Hub resource in the Azure Cloud
4.  Azure IoT Edge Device in said Hub
5.  Set up the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/iotedgedev" target="_blank">Azure IoT Edge Dev Tool</a> which provides a simulation environment for IoT Edge Modules
